// To avoid concurrency problems, it is best to share a few attributes between threads as possible
// If attributes need to be shared, one possible solution is to use isAlive() method of the thread to check
// whether the thread has finished running before using any attributes that the thread can change

// Use isAlive() to prevent concurrency problems:
public class Main extends Thread {
    public static int amount = 0;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Main thread = new Main();
        thread.start();
        // Wait for the thread to finish
        while (thread.isAlive()) {
            System.out.println("Waiting...");
        }
        // Update amount and print its value
        System.out.println("Main: " + amount);
        amount++;
        System.out.println("Main: " + amount);
    }
    public void run() {
       amount++;
 }
